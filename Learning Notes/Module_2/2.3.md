Package design
- Never create packages with Generic responsibility eg: utils/models
- Packages are supposed to be firewalls in micro level.
- Packages should provide purpose. 

First things todo 
- Setup logger and call logger
- Always start your app with INFO and be smart about what you are logging
- As the stdout logger is pretty hard to read
- Better we add a scanner to the logs and they make it beatify.
