- Build Liveness and Readiness handler
    - Two handler for kubnernetes to get working
    - Build this before business logic starts

- Prefer using singular names for packages other than outer later.
    eg: packages
- Two layer of routes
    - Domain level for all the business logic routes
    - System level routes; for K8s

Side Note:
    - Do step by step refactor to get us into better place;
        In terms of Engineering.
    - There is always something I donot like :)
