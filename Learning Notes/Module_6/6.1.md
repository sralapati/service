- Let's talk about Package Oriented Design
    - Design Philoshopies 
        - packaging --> 
        - horizontal layering (how data flows) --> 
        - Domains (talks later)

- Packaging 
    - Every package in the system creates firewalls and this comes from Bryn Curnham
        - https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/02/design-philosophy-on-packaging.html
    - Every package provides purpose; Build packages contain; purpose
    - These packages does API work which perform Data Transformation
    - Think about everything you do and make use of Type system.
    - Every package needs to have it own system; this represens 
        data coming in and data leaving
    - Now we have choices in types; concrete or interfaces
        - Ideally we start with Concrete and move to interfaces
        - This is the data which will be moved around the codebase
    - Polymorphism; a piece of code changes it's behavior depending on the
        concrete data it is operated on. 
    - End of the day we are working with concrete data and that is what matters
    - We call use of Interfaces, run time polymorphysim as we donot know
        concrete data it will operate on
    - Compiletime polymorphsm --> Generics
    - Stick with Run time Poly unless there is specific need for generics
    - Always about redability of code which should help pick these choices

        - Don't design with interfaces; Discover them (google it)

    - Accept interfaces; return strcuts; always return the concerete data
        - We donot have to decouple data for my caller
        - Leave the data for the person that needs it and let him decide
        - We donot write interfaces for others
            We write for our package needs it or our API needs it
