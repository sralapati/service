Design Philosophies/Guidelines
- Do not make things easy todo, make things easy to understand (makes it maintainable, testable and easier for someone to understand)
- Every Encapsulation must define a new Semantic/behavior with precision. 
- We need to Engineer with Clear and Obvious layers of Concern and Purpose. 

If I write a piece of code - it should be maintain, manage and debug 
- It makes us think, if we are violating rules, styles, guidelines, design philosophies. (Refactor if it in that state)
- Stop guess about things. If I don't know enough, stop and ask.
- Always Review and Refactor with open for discussion.
- Get the mental model with Data Model.
- If I leave and company and the code base is re written or thrown - I was useless.
