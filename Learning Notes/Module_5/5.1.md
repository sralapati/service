Core Fundamentals of the Project
`EASY TO UNDERSTAND`
`MAKE THINGS DEFAULT`
-   How to handle Config? 
    - Have to think from day 1
    - Every config should have default values
    - They have to work 100% in dev env
    - Someone can't run the project from the time they clone it; we are slowing things down; `UNACCEPTABLE`
    - Private key is not part of project
    - Layer the instructions out very `clearly` how to get any injectable config

- Creation of Config - practices; Make Config with default values and always use literal struct
    - Create with always literal struct and only pass what is needed around through to all packages/APIs
    - Make things easy to understand.
    - Good practice not to let people set config anywhere
