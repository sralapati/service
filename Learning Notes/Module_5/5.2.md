SIDE TOPIC - GO ROUTINES
- As a general rule, parent go routine shouldn't terminate before child terminates
- There shouldn't be any orphans go routines; there always has to be a

- Trade off adding complexity for readbility and decision making
    - Example debug endpoint which are triggered via go routine
        may not need wait group complexity. As they are read endpoints
